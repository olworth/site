I like NLP, machine learning, linguistics, west ham (most of the time), and cats. This is my site, which I am making using the [11ty static site generator](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) and the [Nunjucks templating engine](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks).

Please excuse the state of it while I finish up writing the content and CSS. In the meantime, I invite you to enjoy a minimal website experience!
