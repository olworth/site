    summary: "I like ML, linguistics, cats, west ham, and indie music from the 80s. This is my site, which I am making using the 11ty static site generator and the Nunjucks templating engine."
    excuse: "Please excuse the state of it while I finish up writing the content and CSS. In the meantime, I invite you to enjoy this minimal and partially-navigable website experience."
