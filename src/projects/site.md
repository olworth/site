My lovely personal website was built using the [11ty static site generator](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) and the [Nunjucks templating engine](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks). Eleventy is an alternative to Jekyll built on top of Node.js. It's super fast and very flexible when it comes to the templating languages you use. I have mostly used Nunjucks, which is fast and super extensible. It was inspired by [Jinja](https://github.com/pallets/jinja) and so has very pretty, Pythonesque syntax.

I've learned a lot about web development through this project and have enjoyed building up my front-end stack. While building the site I developed a couple of nice filters in JavaScript that you are free to use for yourself. Check them out via the GitHub link above!
